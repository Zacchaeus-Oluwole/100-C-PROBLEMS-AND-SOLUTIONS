// Two numbers are said to be amicable if the sum of the proper divisors of one number is
// equal to that of the other number. The proper divisors of a number are the positive prime
// factors of the number other than the number itself. Amicable numbers should not be
// confused with friendly numbers. For instance, the number 220 has the proper divisors 1, 2, 4,
// 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, and 110, whose sum is 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71,
// and 142; their sum is 220. Therefore, the numbers 220 and 284 are said to be amicable.

// The solution to this problem is to iterate through all the numbers up to the given limit. For
// each number, compute the sum of its proper divisors. Letâ€™s call this sum1 . Repeat the
// process and compute the sum of the proper divisors of sum1 . If the result is equal to the
// original number, then the number and sum1 are amicable numbers:

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

        {
            result += (i == (number / i)) ? i : (i + number / i);
        }
    }
    return result;
